# Information-to-Energy
This repository contains the code written by the Information to Energy group during the Rutgers WINLAB 2021 summer internship.
The two files contain code for simulations of Maxwell's Demon and High Pressure Demon.

The following steps can be used to run these files:
1. Upload the file in an IDE
2. Download the pygame, euclid, math, and random modules
3. Run the code

In the Maxwell's Demon code, the error_probability(line 6) variable determines bit error rate, the run_time(line 7) variable determines how long the simulation runs, and the num_particles(line 20) variables determines the number of particles in the simulation.
In the High Pressure Demon code, the deflector_on(line 28) variable determines whether the deflectors are turned on or off, the run_time variable(line 29) determines how long the simulation runs, and the bit_error variable(line 30) determines the bit error rate.
